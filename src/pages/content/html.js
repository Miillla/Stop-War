          Prehistoric Ukraine, as a part of the Pontic steppe in Eastern Europe,
          played an important role in Eurasian cultural contacts, including The
          spread of the Chalcolithic, the Bronze Age, Indo-European migrations
          and the domestication of the horse.[1][2][3] Part of Scythia in
          antiquity and settled by the Greuthungi and Getae in the migration
          period, Ukraine is also the site of early Slavic expansion, and enters
          history proper with the establishment of the medieval state of Kievan
          Rus', which emerged as a powerful nation in the Middle Ages but
          disintegrated by the mid-12th century. During the 14th and 15th
          centuries, present-day Ukrainian territories came under the rule of
          four external powers: the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate, the Grand
          Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The latter
          Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The latter
          two would then merge into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth following
          the Union of Krewo and Union of Lublin. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire,
          would emerge as a major regional power in and around the black sea,
          through protectories like the Crimean Khanate, as well as directly
          administered territory.

        <p style={{ width: "500px" }}>
          The Second World War began in September 1939, when Hitler and Stalin
          invaded Poland, the Soviet Union taking most of Eastern Poland. Nazi
          Germany with its allies invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Some
          Ukrainians initially regarded the Wehrmacht soldiers as liberators
          from Soviet rule, while others formed a partisan movement. Some
          elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a Ukrainian
          Insurgent Army that fought both Soviet forces and the Nazis. Others
          collaborated with the Germans. Some 1.5 million Jews were murdered by
          the Nazis during their occupation.[43] In Volhynia, Ukrainian fighters
          committed a massacre against up to 100,000 Polish civilians.[44]
          Residual small groups of the UPA-partizans acted near the Polish and
          Soviet border as long as to the 1950s.[45] Galicia, Volhynia, South
          Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Carpathian Ruthenia were added as a
          result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 and the Soviet victory
          over Germany in the Second World War, 1939–45. After World War II,
          some amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR were
          accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of
          international law in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a
          part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these
          amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of the founding
          members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and
          the Byelorussian SSR. This was part of a deal with the United States
          to ensure a degree of balance in the General Assembly, which, the USSR
          opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. In its capacity
          as a member of the UN, the Ukrainian SSR was an elected member of the
          United Nations Security Council in 1948–1949 and 1984–1985. The
          Crimean Oblast was transferred from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in
          1954.

          With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine became an
          independent state, formalised with a referendum in December 1991. On
          21 January 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians[46] organized a human chain
          for Ukrainian independence between Kyiv and Lviv. Ukraine officially
          declared itself an independent country on 24 August 1991, when the
          communist Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine proclaimed that
          Ukraine would no longer follow the laws of USSR and only the laws of
          the Ukrainian SSR, de facto declaring Ukraine's independence from the
          Soviet Union. On 1 December, voters approved a referendum formalizing
          independence from the Soviet Union. Over 90% of Ukrainian citizens
          voted for independence, with majorities in every region, including 56%
          in Crimea. The Soviet Union formally ceased to exist on 26 December,
          when the presidents of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (the founding
          members of the USSR) met in Białowieża Forest to formally dissolve the
          Union in accordance with the Soviet Constitution. With this, Ukraine's
          independence was formalized de jure and recognized by the
          international community. Also on 1 December 1991, Ukrainian voters in
          their first presidential election elected Leonid Kravchuk.[47] During
          his presidency, the Ukrainian economy shrank by more than 10% per year
          (in 1994 by more than 20%).[47] The presidency (1994–2005) of the 2nd
          President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, was surrounded by numerous
          corruption scandals and the lessening of media freedoms, including the
          Cassette Scandal.[47][48] During Kuchma's presidency, the economy
          recovered, with GDP growth at around 10% a year in his last years in
          office.[47]

          Orange Revolution and Euromaidan Main articles: Orange Revolution,
          Euromaidan, and Revolution of Dignity In 2004, Kuchma announced that
          he would not run for re-election. Two major candidates emerged in the
          2004 presidential election. Viktor Yanukovych,[49] the incumbent Prime
          Minister, supported by both Kuchma and by the Russian Federation,
          wanted closer ties with Russia. The main opposition candidate, Viktor
          Yushchenko, called for Ukraine to turn its attention westward and aim
          to eventually join the EU. In the runoff election, Yanukovych
          officially won by a narrow margin, but Yushchenko and his supporters
          alleged that vote rigging and intimidation cost him many votes,
          especially in eastern Ukraine. A political crisis erupted after the
          opposition started massive street protests in Kyiv and other cities
          ("Orange Revolution"), and the Supreme Court of Ukraine ordered the
          election results null and void. A second runoff found Viktor
          Yushchenko the winner. Five days later, Yanukovych resigned from
          office and his cabinet was dismissed on 5 January 2005. During the
          Yushchenko term, relations between Russia and Ukraine often appeared
          strained as Yushchenko looked towards improved relations with the
          European Union and less toward Russia.[50] In 2005, a highly
          publicized dispute over natural gas prices with Russia caused
          shortages in many European countries that were reliant on Ukraine as a
          transit country.[51] A compromise was reached in January 2006.[51] By
          the time of the presidential election of 2010, Yushchenko and Yulia
          Tymoshenko — allies during the Orange Revolution[52] — had become
          bitter enemies.[47] Tymoshenko ran for president against both
          Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, creating a three-way race.
          Yushchenko, whose popularity had plummeted,[50] persisted in running,
          and many pro-Orange voters stayed home.[53] In the second round of the
          election, Yanukovych won the run-off ballot with 48% to Tymoshenko's
          45%.[54] During his presidency (2010–2014), Yanukovych and his Party
          of Regions were accused of trying to create a "controlled democracy"
          in Ukraine and of trying to destroy the main opposition party Bloc
          Yulia Tymoshenko, but both have denied these charges.[55] One
          frequently cited example of Yanukovych's attempts to centralise power
          was the 2011 sentencing of Yulia Tymoshenko, which has been condemned
          by Western governments as potentially being politically motivated.[56]
          2014 Euromaidan protests in Kyiv In November 2013, President
          Yanukovych did not sign the Ukraine–European Union Association
          Agreement and instead pursued closer ties with Russia.[57][58] This
          move sparked protests on the streets of Kyiv and, ultimately, the
          Revolution of Dignity. Protesters set up camps in Kyiv's Maidan
          Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square),[59] and in December 2013 and
          January 2014 protesters started taking over various government
          buildings, first in Kyiv, and later in Western Ukraine.[60] Battles
          between protesters and police resulted in about 80 deaths in February
          2014.[61][62] Following the violence, the Ukrainian parliament on 22
          February voted to remove Yanukovych from power (on the grounds that
          his whereabouts were unknown and he thus could not fulfil his duties),
          and to free Yulia Tymoshenko from prison. On the same day, Yanukovych
          supporter Volodymyr Rybak resigned as speaker of the Parliament, and
          was replaced by Tymoshenko loyalist Oleksandr Turchynov, who was
          subsequently installed as interim President.[63] Yanukovych had fled
          Kyiv, and subsequently gave a press conference in the Russian city of
          Rostov-on-Don.

          On 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the DCFTA with the EU. Ukrainian
          citizens were granted visa-free travel to the Schengen Area for up to
          90 days during any 180-day period on 11 June 2017, and the Association
          Agreement formally came into effect on 1 September 2017.[65]
          Significant achievements in the foreign policy arena include support
          for anti-Russian sanctions, obtaining a visa-free regime with the
          countries of the European Union, and better recognition of the need to
          overcome extremely difficult tasks within the country. On 21 April
          2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in the second round of
          the presidential election. Early parliamentary elections on July 21
          allowed the newly formed pro-presidential Servant of the People party
          to win an absolute majority of seats for the first time in the history
          of independent Ukraine (248). Dmytro Razumkov, the party's chairman,
          was elected speaker of parliament. The majority was able to form a
          government on August 29 on its own, without forming coalitions, and
          approved Oleksii Honcharuk as prime minister.[71] On March 4, 2020,
          due to a 1.5% drop in GDP (instead of a 4.5% increase at the time of
          the election), the Verkhovna Rada fired Honcharuk's government and
          Denys Shmyhal[72] became the new Prime Minister.[73]

          In March 2014, the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation
          occurred. Though official results of a referendum on Crimean
          reunification with Russia were reported as showing a large majority in
          favor of the proposition, the vote was organized under Russian
          military occupation and was denounced by the European Union and the
          United States as illegal.[78] War in Donbas, Pervomaisk City, July
          2014 The Crimean crisis was followed by pro-Russian unrest in east
          Ukraine and south Ukraine.[79] In April 2014 Ukrainian separatists
          self-proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic and Lugansk People's
          Republic and held referendums on 11 May 2014; the separatists claimed
          nearly 90% voted in favor of independence.[80][79] Later in April
          2014, fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-Ukrainian volunteer
          battalions on one side, and forces supporting the Donetsk and Lugansk
          People's Republics on the other side, escalated into the War in
          Donbas.[79][81] By December 2014, more than 6,400 people had died in
          this conflict, and according to United Nations figures it led to over
          half a million people becoming internally displaced within Ukraine and
          two hundred thousand refugees to flee to (mostly) Russia and other
          neighboring countries.[82][83][84][85] During the same period,
          political (including adoption of the law on lustration and the law on
          decommunization) and economic reforms started.[86] On 25 May 2014,
          Petro Poroshenko was elected president[87] in the first round of the
          presidential election. By the second half of 2015, independent
          observers noted that reforms in Ukraine had considerably slowed down,
          corruption did not subside, and the economy of Ukraine was still in a
          deep crisis.[86][88][89][90] By December 2015, more than 9,100 people
          had died (largely civilians) in the War in Donbas,[91] according to
          United Nations figures.[92] On February 2, 2021, a presidential decree
          banned the television broadcasting of the pro-Russian TV channels 112
          Ukraine, NewsOne and ZIK.[93][94] The decision of the National
          Security and Defense Council and the Presidential Decree of February
          19, 2021 imposed sanctions on 8 individuals and 19 legal entities,
          including Putin's pro-Russian politician and Putin's godfather Viktor
          Medvedchuk and his wife Oksana Marchenko.[95][96] The Kerch Strait
          incident occurred on 25 November 2018 when the Russian Federal
          Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three
          Ukrainian Navy vessels attempting to pass from the Black Sea into the
          Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of
          Mariupol.[97][98] Throughout 2021, Russian forces built up along the
          Russia-Ukraine Border. On February 24, 2022 Russian forces invaded
          Ukraine. Russia quickly occupied much of the south and east of the
          country, but failed to take the north including Kyiv
